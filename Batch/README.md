# Batch

**(Almost all of my batch files from 2014 when I was 10 and in Grade 4 till now is gone forever, I lost the floppy disks.)**

 One of them opened and closed my disc drive and I uploaded it to the internet. The next month my antivirus flagged it as malicious. So it's safe to say I made a malicious program by accident.
