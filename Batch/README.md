# Batch
This is all of my batch scripts I've made (and recovered).

**(Almost all of my batch files that I made on Windows XP from 2014 when I was 10 and in Grade 4 till now are gone forever, I lost the floppy disks.)**

 One of them opens and closes the dvd drive in the background every 30 minutes. I uploaded it to the internet and the next month my antivirus got it's monthly update and flagged my dvd.bat as malicious. So it's safe to say I made a malicious program by accident and the antivirus providers flagged it.
