# My Stuff
This is everything I've worked on during my life using Notepad and VS Code.  
Started with Batch in 2014.  
Started with Python in 2023. 
## Batch
    <Insert Code>
<p style="text-align: center;">Output: ...</p>

## Python
    def nameSurname(firstName, lastName):
    	print(firstName, lastName)

    name = "SJ"
	surname = "Pretorius"
	nameSurname(name, surname)
<p style="text-align: center;">Output: SJ Pretorius</p>
