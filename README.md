# My Stuff
This is everything I've worked on during my life using Notepad and VS Code.  
Started with Batch in 2014.  
Started with Python in 2023. 
### Batch
    @echo off

    :main
    set name=SJ
    set surname=Pretorius
    goto name

    :name
    echo %name% %surname%
<p align="center">Output: SJ Pretorius</p>

### Python
    def nameSurname(firstName, lastName):
    	print(firstName, lastName)

    name = "SJ"
	surname = "Pretorius"
	nameSurname(name, surname)
<p align="center">Output: SJ Pretorius</p>
